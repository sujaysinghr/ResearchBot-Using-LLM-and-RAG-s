      " RAGs (Retrieval-Augmented Generative models) are a type of natural language processing model that combines the best of both worlds from \"closed-book\" and \"open-book\" approaches to question answering.

It can also be used for abstractive question answering, where it generates free-form, factually correct answers to questions. Additionally, RAGs can be employed in specific domains, such as medical knowledge, to assist in answering questions and providing relevant information.\n",

      "The benefits of RAGs include its grounding in real factual knowledge, which reduces the chances of generating false or biased information. It also offers more control and interpretability compared to other language models. This makes it useful in a wide range of scenarios, such as assisting professionals in their work or providing information to the general public.\n",
